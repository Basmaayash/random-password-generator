# Random Password Generator 🔐

Random Password Generator is a simple web application that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords.
Users can customize the password length and choose which character types to include, such as uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

The application also provides a password strength indicator that shows whether the generated password is
weak, medium, or strong, helping users create safer passwords.
